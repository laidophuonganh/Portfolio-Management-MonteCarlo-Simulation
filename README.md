# Portfolio Analysis and Optimization (2024)

## Methodology
The technology industry in 2024 is characterized by rapid innovation and heightened volatility, driven by advancements in AI, semiconductor demand, and shifting macroeconomic policies (Deloitte, 2024). This environment necessitates a portfolio that balances diversification, robust financial evaluation, and adaptability to dynamic market conditions. 

### Stock Selection
- **Source**: Stocks were selected from the Nasdaq-100 Index (NDXT), a benchmark of 100 large non-financial companies heavily representing the technology sector.
- **Approach**: A combination of Fundamental and Quantitative Analysis was employed:
  - **Key Metrics**: Profitability, growth, and valuation metrics were normalized and aggregated into a composite scoring system.
  - **Ranking**: Companies were ranked based on overall quality, with the top five included in the portfolio.

### Portfolio Weighting
- **Method**: A Monte Carlo Simulation was applied to determine portfolio weights.
- **Optimization**: The simulation optimized the Sharpe Ratio, balancing risk and return.
- **Constraints**: Ensured that no stock exceeded 40% of the total investment, adhering to client requirements.

## Results
### Performance Overview
The strategy was simulated for all four quarters of 2024, with the portfolio rebalanced on the 1st day of the first month in each quarter. This quarterly rebalancing strategy aligns with the dynamic nature of the technology sector. 

- **Stocks Included**: NVDA, FTNT, PANW, KLAC, AAPL.
- **Expected Return**: 66.7%
- **Standard Deviation**: 31.9% (reflecting moderate volatility).
- **Sharpe Ratio**: 2.089 (excellent balance between risk and return).

### Cumulative Performance
The portfolio achieved competitive returns relative to benchmarks, demonstrating resilience and strong performance over the year.
